Our API uses Node.js and Express for the server-side implementation and MongoDB for data storage. We have implemented RESTful endpoints that enable HTTP requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. Additionally, we have implemented robust error handling to ensure that our API is reliable and can handle unexpected inputs.

Whether you're building a simple chat application or a full-featured social network, our API provides the tools you need to create an engaging and dynamic user experience. Our goal is to provide developers with a flexible and easy-to-use API that can be customized to fit a variety of use cases. So why wait? Start building your social media app today.

To properly use our API routes, first make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you have these installed, you can clone our repository and install the required dependencies using npm.

To start the server, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the command npm start. This will start the server and allow you to make HTTP requests to our API endpoints.

Our API provides the following routes:

/api/users: This route allows you to get all users and create a new user.
/api/users/:id: This route allows you to get a specific user by ID, update a user by ID, or delete a user by ID.
/api/users/:id/friends/:friendId: This route allows you to add a friend to a user or remove a friend from a user.
/api/hmms: This route allows you to get all hmms and create a new hmm.
/api/hmms/:id: This route allows you to get a specific hmm by ID, update a hmm by ID, or delete a hmm by ID.
/api/hmms/:id/retorts: This route allows you to add a retort to a hmm.
/api/hmms/:id/retorts/:retortId: This route allows you to delete a retort from a hmm.
When making HTTP requests to our API endpoints, make sure to include the appropriate request headers and provide the necessary request parameters in the URL. Our API will return JSON responses that include the requested resource or an error message if something goes wrong.

We hope that our API provides you with everything you need to create a dynamic and engaging social media application. If you have any questions or encounter any issues while using our API, please don't hesitate to contact us.
